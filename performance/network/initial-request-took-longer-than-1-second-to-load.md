Slow response times increase page abandonment with the average user only waiting
6-10 seconds before leaving a site. Response times of less than 1 second feels
instantaneous to the user, while in the range of 1 second a user maintains his/her
thought process. Anywhere from 6 seconds and longer, the user loses patience with
the site and will abandon it.

* Combine external JavaScript and CSS files
* Reduce the number of HTTP requests being made
