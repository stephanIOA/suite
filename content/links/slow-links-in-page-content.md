Having slow links in your page content ruins the user experience. You will risk user engagement, declining search engine ranking and possibly reduced income.

# How do I fix this ?

* Reduce HTTP requests.
* Use as less media (images, video) as possible.
* Make sure caching is enabled, even at page level.
* Keep styles at the top and scripts at the bottom of your pages.
* Use gzipping, minification and combine CSS and JavaScript files.
* Make sure links aren't redirecting as this adds to the loading time.
